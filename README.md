# C-Programs-College

In this repo, I will be adding all the practice questions and problems that I gather from my college, internet and other sources.
All the Problems so pushed are already in solved form. If you all, come up with any program optimisation ideas then feel free to create a PR.

## Happy C-oding ;)
